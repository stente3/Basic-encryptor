### Prerequisites

* Node.js: Make sure you have the latest stable version of Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from the official Node.js website.
* NPM: Use NPM (Node Package Manager) as your package manager. It's the default package manager in Node.js.
* Code Editor: Choose a code editor such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom to write and modify your project's source code.
* Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: Familiarize yourself with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as they are fundamental for web development and essential for working with Vite.js.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository in the terminal 
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/stente3/Basic-encryptor.git
   ```

## Usage
Once you have set up the folder structure and installed the necessary prerequisites as mentioned in the respective sections, you can follow these steps to start using your project built with Vite.js:

1. **Start Development Server:** Open a command-line interface (CLI) and navigate to the root folder of your project.

2. **Run Development Mode:** Launch the Vite.js development server by executing the following command:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
This command will start the development server, and you'll be able to access your project in the browser at http://localhost:3000. Any changes you make to your source code will automatically trigger hot module replacement, providing a smooth development experience.

3. **Customize Your Project:** Make modifications to the files within the 'src/' directory based on your project requirements. Here's a brief overview of the different directories within the src/ directory:

+ designs/: This directory can be used to store design-related assets such as mockups or wireframes.
+ js/: Place your JavaScript files in this directory.
+ img/: Store your image files here.
+ styles/: This directory contains the CSS files for your project.
  - normalize.css: A CSS file that helps standardize the default styles across different browsers.
  - styles.css: Customize this file to define the styles specific to your project.

4. **Build for Production:** When you're ready to build your project for production, run the following command:
   ```
   npm run build
   ``` 
   This command will generate an optimized and minified version of your project in the dist/ directory, which is ready to be deployed to a web server.

That's it! You can now start developing and customizing your project using Vite.js. Refer to the Vite.js documentation for more information on advanced configurations and features.

Remember to consult the Vite.js documentation and other relevant resources for detailed information on utilizing Vite.js effectively and maximizing its capabilities for your project.
